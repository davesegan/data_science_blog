You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Math Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\n1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams.

The density of forest alongside Mack Creek varies greatly between different forest sections due to historic forest clear-cutting. It is not fully understood whether the clear-cutting of forest has had a significant impact on the Pacific Giant Salamander population in Mack Creek. Fortunately, for the purposes of this report, the Pacific Giant Salamander population along Mack Creek has been monitored in both a clear-cut forest section and a 500-year-old, old-growth forest section since 1993 (Gregory S. V. 2016). Data from this monitoring of Pacific Giant Salamanders includes the specific location of individual observations, overall counts, and individual weights (Gregory S. V. 2016). Here, we analyze this data to provide insight into the the effect that forest clear-cutting has on Pacific Giant Salamander populations in Mack Creek.\nMack Creek Location. Dana Warren.\n Pacific Giant Salamander. Photo by Karl H. Switak\n  Data and Methods Annually collected data on the Pacific giant salamanders from 1993 to 2017 in the old growth section and the previously clear-cut section of the Andrews Experimental Forest was used for the analysis. Among these two groups, counts, weights, and location of salamanders within the Mack Creek channel (pool, cascade, or side-channel) were analyzed using a significance level of 0.05. For more information on collection methods and variables, see metadata. A chi-squared test was used to determine if there is a significant effect of forest condition (old growth vs clear cut) on where in the channel Pacific Giant Salamander’s are found (Cascades, Side-Channel, and Pool). A two-sample t-test was used to compare the weights of Pacific Giant Salamanders between the two forest sections. Lastly, a one-way ANOVA test, along with Tukey’s HSD and Cohen’s D for post-hoc testing was conducted to compare mean weights across channel locations.\n Results Part A: Visual Comparison of Salamander Counts Figure 1: Counts of Pacific Giant Salamander’s compared between clear-cut forest section and old-growth forest section between 1993 and 2017.\nTrends in Giant Pacific Salamander counts were compared between clear-cut and old-growth forest sections between 1993 and 2017 (Figure 1). Noticeably, there is little visual difference in the fluctuation of salamander counts in old-growth and clear-cut forest sections. Despite little difference in the fluctuation of salamander counts, on average, salamander counts in old-growth forest sections were greater until 2014. Populations of Giant Pacific Salamanders in both the clear-cut and old-growth forest sections experienced significant decline in populations between 2013 and 2015.\n Results B: 2017 Salamander Counts by Channel Classification Table 1: 2017 Salamander counts by channel classification (pool, cascades, and side-channel) in old-growth and clear-cut sections of Mack Creek. Proportions provide insight into the relationship that exists between forest section and the channel section where Pacific Giant Salamanders were observed.   Section  Cascades  Pool  Side Channel      Clear Cut  247 (67.1%)  31 (8.4%)  90 (24.5%)    Old Growth  201 (62.8%)  45 (14.1%)  74 (23.1%)      Results C: Analysis of Salamander Counts by Channel Classification A chi-squared test of independence was conducted to analyze whether there is a significant effect of forest condition on the channel classification where Pacific Giant Salamanders were observed. The analysis shows that, at a 95% confidence level, there is not a significant effect of forest section on where Pacific Giant Salamanders were observed (p-value: 0.0626). Despite unequal distribution of salamander counts across forest sections (as seen in Table 1), there is not a statistically significant relationship that exists between forest section and channel classification at the 95% confidence level.\n Results D: Pacific Giant Salamander Weights by Section Figure 2: Comparison of weights of Pacific Giant Salamanders observed in clear-cut forest section and old-growth forest section. Mean weight is displayed as black dot with error bars that display one standard deviation from mean. Mean weight of Pacific Giant Salamanders in clear-cut forest sections = 7.78g, and old-growth forest section = 6.58g.\nA Welch’s two sample t-test was conducted to analyze whether there is a significant difference in mean weight of Pacific Giant Salamanders in clear-cut and old-growth forest sections. Test results show that, at a 95% confidence level, there is not a significant difference in the mean weight of Pacific Giant Salamanders between the two forest sections (p-value: 0.096). These results reinforce findings in Results A, Results B, and Results C, that indicate that there is no significant effect of forest section on Pacific Giant Salamander populations in Mack Creek.\n Results E: Means Comparison of Salamander Weight by Channel Classification Figure 3: Comparison of weights of Pacific Giant Salamanders observed in Cascades, Pools, or Side Channels.\n Figure 4: QQ plot to explore normalcy of data spread for weights of Pacific Giant Salamanders observed in different channel classifications (Cascades, Pool, Side-Channel). Actual values of observations were plotted with theoretical normal values and yielded slightly abnormal results.\n Levene’s Test for Equal Variance  Levene’s Test Result: With a p-value of 0.093, this is not significant and we retain the null hypothesis of equal variances.   One-way ANOVA \u0026amp; Post-Hoc Testing:  ANOVA Result: Mean salamander weight (g) differed significantly between the three channel classifications (pool, cascade, side-channel) based on a one-way ANOVA test (F(2, 684) = 4.22, p-value = 0.015). Tukey’s HSD Result: Pairwise testing reveals that mean weights of Pool salamanders differ significantly from Side Channel salamanders (p-value = 0.017), however, means of other pairwise combinations do not differ significantly. Pool salamanders and Cascade salamanders: (p-value = 0.286). Side channel salamanders and Cascade salamanders: (p-value = 0.084) Effect size: Even though a significant difference in means is found between salamanders sampled in pools vs. side-channels, the effect size is small as tested with Cohen’s d: (d estimate = 0.35)   Analysis of Results  An Anova test was conducted to compare mean weights of salamanders across channel classifications, regardless of forest section. The results show that at the 95% confidence level, mean salamander weight was only significantly different between salamanders in side channels vs those in pools. While significantly different, the effect size is small, thus leading a conclusion that there is not considerable difference in Pacific Giant Salamander weight across channel classifications. Prior to conducting the ANOVA, a QQ plot was created to evaluate normalcy of the weight distributions. The QQ plot revealed that the distributions of weights within each channel type is slightly abnormal. While this raises slight concern for the effectiveness of an ANOVA, it is widely accepted that an ANOVA is robust to violation of the normality assumption. Coupled with a Levene’s test that indicates non-significant difference in variance, the results of the ANOVA test are still valuable. Median weights should be compared for further analysis.    Summary  Pacific Giant Salamander counts have fluctuated greatly in Mack Creek from 1993 to 2018. These fluctuations have largely been the same in the previously clear cut section of the forest as in the old growth section of forest (Figure 1). In 2017, mean weight of Pacfic Giant Salamanders sampled in clear-cut forests were 1.2 grams larger (~18% larger) than those sampled in old growth forest sections.(Figure 2) Despite differences in actual data, statistical tests show inconclusive evidence that any strong relationships exist at the 95% confidence level between 1) forest section and where the Pacific Giant Salamander are found, 2) weights of the salamanders across forest sections, and 3) weights of the salamanders across channel classifications.

Like much of the Santa Barbara coastline, Isla Vista and Naples are home to the spiny lobster. The spiny lobster serves as an important predator in kelp forests off the California coastline (Reed 2019). Since 2012, the Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research program (SBC LTER) has collected annual data on the size and abundance of spiny lobsters from five sites along the Santa Barbara coastline (Reed 2019). The SBC LTER data is collected from the two MPA sites mentioned above and three non-MPA sites along the Santa Barbara coastline, Mohawk, Arroyo Quemado, and Carpinteria. A comparison of the size and abundance of spiny lobsters between these five sites provides useful insight into the impact that MPAs have spiny lobster populations. This report uses the SBC LTER data to analyze the effect that MPAs have had on the size and abundance of spiny lobsters along the Santa Barbara coastline between 2012 and 2018.\nCalifornia Spiny Lobsters offshore of Anacapa Island. Photo by Ed Bierman\n  Data and Methods Data used for this study includes: 1) spiny lobster counts within designated transects at each site measured annually in late summer before the fishing season, and 2) the visually estimated sizes of these lobsters. Visualizations and statistics were used to identify interesting trends of these variables. Two sided T-tests were conducted to measure the significance of differences in mean lobster sizes and counts between Marine Protected Areas and non-Marine Protected Areas and also between 2012 and 2018 for each of those two groups. These tests were conducted at a 5% signficance level. Software used for this analysis includes R-Studio Version 1.2.1335 and GitHub.\n Results A. Spiny Lobster Counts  Figure 1: Figure 1: Annual change in spiny lobster population between the five Santa Barbara coastline data collection sites (Isla Vista, Naples, Carpinteria, Mohawk, and Arroyo Quemado) from 2012 to 2018. MPA sites are delineated with red lines and non-MPA sites are delineated with blue lines.  Interesting trends:  Isla Vista has seen the largest increase in spiny lobster count by far among the five locations analyzed Populations increased by well over 100% in Isla Vista and Carpenteria from 2016 - 2017 Marine Protected Areas showed gradual increase in lobster counts following their protection status in January, 2012 but this did not persist for Naples Carpinteria (Non-MPA) and Isla Vista (MPA) were on similar trajectories between 2016 and 2017. Carpentiria, which is a non-MPA saw a major decline between 2017 and 2018, whereas Isla Vista, which is an MPA, did not.      B. Size Distribution Comparison  Figure 2: Figure 2: Spread of lobster sizes for each of the five Santa Barbara coastline sites for the years 2012 and 2018. Red colors are for Marine Protected Area sites while blue colors are for non-Marine Protected Area Sites. Change in median size from 2012-2018 for MPA was +13.5 mm while change in median size for non-MPA was -2 mm. Data: Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research program  Interesting trends:  Marine Protected Areas (Naples and Isla Vista) saw very clear increases in median sizes from 2012 to 2018 The spread of sizes noticibly decreased for Naples, Mohawk, and Carpenteria from 2012 - 2018, while it did not change at Arroyo Quemado and it increased at Isla Vista.

From 2012 and 2018, the mean size of spiny lobsters increased by 15% for MPA sites whereas it decreased by 2% for non-MPA sites. Between 2012 and 2018, mean spiny lobster sizes in the MPA sites went from being 7.55mm smaller than spiny lobsters in non-MPAs to being 3.95mm larger.   References Reed D. 2019.
