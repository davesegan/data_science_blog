# Data and Methods

# - Data: 
# - How analyzed:
# - Variables studied
# - Statistcal tests:
# - Significance leve: 5%
# - Software

# Data used for this study includes 1) annual spiny lobster counts within designated transects at each site and 2) the visually estimated sizes of these lobsters measured by divers. Visualizations and statistical analysis were used to identify interesting trends of these variables. T-tests were conducted to measure the significance of differences in mean lobster sizes and counts between Marine Protected Areas and non-Marine Protected Areas and also between 2012 and 2018 for each of those two groups. These tests were conducted at a 5% signficance level. Software used for this analysis includes R-Studio Version 1.2.1335 and GitHub. 

# Box plots were used to show size distributions for lobsters observed at the five difference sites in 2012 and 2018.
