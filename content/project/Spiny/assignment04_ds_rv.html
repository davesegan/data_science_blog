<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>In 2012, the California Fish and Game Network of Marine Protected Areas (MPA) established two MPAs along the Santa Barbara coastline, one in Isla Vista and another in Naples (Reed 2019). Like much of the Santa Barbara coastline, Isla Vista and Naples are home to the spiny lobster. The spiny lobster serves as an important predator in kelp forests off the California coastline (Reed 2019). Since 2012, the Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research program (SBC LTER) has collected annual data on the size and abundance of spiny lobsters from five sites along the Santa Barbara coastline (Reed 2019). The SBC LTER data is collected from the two MPA sites mentioned above and three non-MPA sites along the Santa Barbara coastline, Mohawk, Arroyo Quemado, and Carpinteria. A comparison of the size and abundance of spiny lobsters between these five sites provides useful insight into the impact that MPAs have spiny lobster populations. This report uses the SBC LTER data to analyze the effect that MPAs have had on the size and abundance of spiny lobsters along the Santa Barbara coastline between 2012 and 2018.</p>

<h3><strong>Data and Methods</strong></h3>
<p>Data used for this study includes: 1) spiny lobster counts within designated transects at each site measured annually in late summer before the fishing season, and 2) the visually estimated sizes of these lobsters. Visualizations and statistics were used to identify interesting trends of these variables. Two sided T-tests were conducted to measure the significance of differences in mean lobster sizes and counts between Marine Protected Areas and non-Marine Protected Areas and also between 2012 and 2018 for each of those two groups. These tests were conducted at a 5% signficance level. Software used for this analysis includes R-Studio Version 1.2.1335 and GitHub.</p>

<h5>Interesting trends:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Isla Vista has seen the largest increase in spiny lobster count by far among the five locations analyzed</li>
<li>Populations increased by well over 100% in Isla Vista and Carpenteria from 2016 - 2017</li>
<li>Marine Protected Areas showed gradual increase in lobster counts following their protection status in January, 2012 but this did not persist for Naples</li>
<li>Carpinteria (Non-MPA) and Isla Vista (MPA) were on similar trajectories between 2016 and 2017. Carpentiria, which is a non-MPA saw a major decline between 2017 and 2018, whereas Isla Vista, which is an MPA, did not.</li>
