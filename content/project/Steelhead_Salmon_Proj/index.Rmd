### Introduction

This analysis looks at Steelhead salmon passage across the Bonneville Dam in Oregon from 1940 - 2019. The primary data collection is done byt the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The data includes counts of Steelhead Salmon recorded daily. There were days that did not include any salmon recordings and these data were removed from the analysis. Included in this analysis are a graph of daily recordings, a comparison of how seasonal recordings have changed over the years, and a graph of annual counts.

# Note on data classes: year is number & mm_dd is character
# Also mm_dd is mislabeled, it is actually dd_mm
```

```{r}

steelhead_dates <- steelhead %>% 
  # combine date columns using str_c
  mutate(yr_day_mo = str_c(year, mm_dd, sep = "-")) %>% 
  # convert to date format using parse_date_time
  mutate(yr_mo_day = lubridate::parse_date_time(yr_day_mo, "ydm")) %>% 
  # add month, day, & year columns and remove unneccesary date columns
  select(-mm_dd, -year, -yr_day_mo) %>% 
  mutate(month = month(yr_mo_day, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(day = day(yr_mo_day)) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(yr_mo_day))
  
  
```

  # note, value is the count of salmon that were recorded passing the damn

- There was a large spike in steelhead salmon counts in August 2009.

```

- The largest amount of steelhead salmon pass through the Bonneville Dam in the summer months.
- The number of total salmon observed has increased overtime.

steel_annual <- steel_timeseries %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%

```
 
 - Steelhead Salmon counts increased dramatically starting in 1980 with peaks in 2001 and 2009
 - There has been an equally drastic drop in counts in the past decade
